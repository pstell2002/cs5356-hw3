    <p> Hi, I'm Stella Park, a Master's student studying Information Sciences. 
        My technical experience mostly lies in web/app development - I made this website from scratch using html. I additionally have experience with 
        entrepreneurship and business development. 
        I'm open to part-timefall/spring/winter and full-time summer internships.
